# Linklib
## A cache of links to audio files that you find interesting and enlightening. Sharable and discussable. 



The general aim of Linklib is to play the role of a digital library of audio files such as lectures, debates, and podcasts (publicly available content) so that one can maintain their own cache of links they find helpful.


## The Minimum Viable Product:

* Site connects to MongoDB to maintain collection of 'entries'
* The site allows users to create entries of publicly hosted MP3 files
* Entries of Mp3 files will contain:
  * Author Name
  * Media File Name
  * Date Added
  * Description of Entry
  * Topic/Format Tags
* These files will be publicly visible in a feed 



##  Reasonable Extentions of MVP

* User Authentication and accounts.
* Marking entries as private so they don't show up publicly
* Comments/discussion available for each entry
* Entries are searchable by name, author, tag, or topic


## Ambitious Extensions of MVP

* 'Series' collections, which reference different entries and organize them in series.
* Websockets on discussion of entries
* Users are 'Followable', so that users following the group will be notified when new files are released
